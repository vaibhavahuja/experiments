### Concurrency

#### Goal

- To understand how concurrency works in goLang
- MultiThreading? Is that possible, or will it work in one thread itself
- Conclude how goLang makes concurrency that easy
- Document (with comments or here later)

Will try to implement concurrency Patterns as described in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6kdp27TYZs&t=1021s&ab_channel=GoogleDevelopers)
