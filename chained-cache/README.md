### Functional Requirements

- Add multiple layers of caching
- Keys should be highly generic
- Invalidation on basis of time, and move to L2 Cache
- Can enable/disable cache/s when I want
- Modify implementation of cache without much effort.
- In case of any modification in Ln, propagate change to all lower caches (L1, L2, ...., Ln)


### Learnings
- Learn generics
- Learn interfaces
- Use test methods for now, not real cache
- Use design patterns to come up with a great chained cache
